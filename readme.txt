Arduino IDE is a simple GUI software that helps the noob guy to interface himself with Arduino environment and ATmega and ATtiny MCU's.
What Gioblu Robotics want to do is simply spread Arduino community giving to the noob the possibility to use many ATtiny and ATmega family MCU's, and to the skilled guy a place wear put his stuff that want to share to community.
The list, analyzing the web is very long, so long that creates problems visualizing it correctly. Actually I can't enter all portings because the "board" dropdownlist goes out of the screen.
I am reasoning about dividing ATmega and ATtiny family MCU or some other categorization to reduce the list number :P

INSTALLATION
Detailed instructions are in reference/Guide_Windows.html and
reference/Guide_MacOSX.html.  For Linux, see the Arduino playground:
http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/Linux

If you are using a USB Arduino, you will need to install the drivers for the
FTDI chip on the board. These can be found in the drivers/ directory.

* On Windows, plug in the Arduino board and point the Windows Add Hardware
  wizard to the drivers/FTDI USB Drivers sub-directory of the Arduino
  application directory.

* On the Mac, install the FTDIUSBSerialDriver_10_4_10_5_10_6.mpkg package.
  
* On Linux, drivers are included in kernel versions 2.4.20 or greater.
