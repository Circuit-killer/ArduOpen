Arduino IDE is a simple GUI software that helps the noob guy to interface himself with Arduino environment and ATmega and ATtiny MCU's.
What Gioblu Robotics wants to do is simply to broaden the Arduino community by giving noobs the possibility to use many ATtiny and ATmega family MCU's, and the skilled ones a place where they can put their stuff they want to share with the community. While browsing the web I found many ports of Arduino, so many, in fact, that showing them in the drop down menu is a problem by itself. I am thinking about dividing ATmega and ATtiny families, or some other categorization to reduce the menu's length. 

ISSUES:
- Add a theme button where you can choose a template for your editor
- New fancy icons :P
- "Board" dropdown list modification / split to avoid out of screen list problem
- Add new library
- Add new examples tutorial related

INSTALLATION
Detailed instructions are in reference/Guide_Windows.html and
reference/Guide_MacOSX.html.  For Linux, see the Arduino playground:
http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/Linux

If you are using a USB Arduino, you will need to install the drivers for the
FTDI chip on the board. These can be found in the drivers/ directory.

* On Windows, plug in the Arduino board and point the Windows Add Hardware
  wizard to the drivers/FTDI USB Drivers sub-directory of the Arduino
  application directory.

* On the Mac, install the FTDIUSBSerialDriver_10_4_10_5_10_6.mpkg package.
  
* On Linux, drivers are included in kernel versions 2.4.20 or greater.
